Hi, I’m Matthew, a software developer from the UK with over 11 years of experience in the industry.
I am currently employed as the Lead Software Developer at Broughton Software Ltd., where I lead the development of LabHQ LIMS—a cutting-edge SaaS solution designed to simplify laboratory management.
You can learn more about LabHQ [here](https://thelabhq.com/).

When I’m not at my computer, you might find me juggling family life as a father, bouldering/climbing, playing squash, cooking, or just strumming my guitar.
I may occasionally share posts about some of my other interests on this blog.

## Why Blog in 2024

### The Need for Documentation

Over the years, working at Broughton Software has taught me valuable lessons about what makes software products successful, particularly in the SaaS space.
Starting my career at 23, I’ve recently come to realise the importance of documenting my insights rather than relying solely on my memory.
With the ever-expanding array of tools, techniques, and patterns, having a centralised place to record it all should turn out to be very beneficial.

### Reflecting on Growth

Lately, I’ve found it challenging to identify clear paths for growth or new areas to explore in my professional journey.
This blog is intended to serve as a reflective space where I can track my progress, organise my thoughts, and discover new opportunities for advancement.
By documenting my experiences, I hope to be able to reflect more easily and push the boundaries of my own development.

### Giving Back to the Community

This blog also aims to provide value to the wider software development community.
I want to share useful insights, lessons learned, and best practices that could benefit others in the field.
I feel that I’ve gained more from the community than I’ve given back over the years, so now it’s time for me to contribute.
I invite you to join me on this journey of continuous learning and self-reflection.

_Remember: don't lean on your memory._
